These Cheat Sheets will be helpful to anyone who wants to learn or go through the concepts of latest technologies in a short period of time. Also posted on the github page of Venturesity VIT.

## Description

These cheat sheets are meant to be used for increased productivity while developing. In no way are they exhaustive of the topics they are covering. But they cover most of the basic requirements/commands/processes/tags/functions etc that one may use frequently.
